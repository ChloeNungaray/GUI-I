            <p class="border"> Hello, my name is Chloe, and I am a senior at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. I am taking 
                six courses this semester: GUI I, Intro to Cybersecurity, Cyber Defense, Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Analysis 
                of Algorithms. I am set to graduate with my BS in Computer science in May 2022. I also have a minor in Mathematics. 
                Currently, I work in IT Tech Services for UMass Lowell and have been working there for over a year.</p>

                    and in the right photo, I was holding a snake. It was my first time holding either of these creatures, and it was an exciting 
                    experience. I love trying new things even if they are a bit scary at first. I would do it again if I had the chance!
